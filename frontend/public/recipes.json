      "Stir in the dairy-free yogurt/applesauce, vanilla extract, and lemon juice into the sugar/butter mixture until combined.",
      "Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients to form a dough. I recommend using a wooden spoon.",
      "Fold in white chocolate chips.",

      "Scoop the cookie dough onto the baking sheet, roughly the size of 2 tablespoons per cookie and bake for 10–12 minutes, or until edges are golden brown.",
      "Let cookies cool for about 10 minutes and then enjoy :)"
